In 2004, the regular broadcast of the animated series began on TV channels Russia (now Russia-1; as part of the Good Night, Kids! program) and STS. Back in 2003, the planned number of episodes was announced - 200. Subsequently, this number was expanded by 15 additional episodes filmed on special orders from the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, the National Children's Fund and the Radio Plant. A.S.
